# Investigate Welfare Program
This dataset collects information from a hundred thousand medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

The questions this analysis tries to answer are:
<li> What is the comparison of the juveniles that showed for appointment to those that did not?</li>
<li> How does the welfare program affect showing or not showing for appoinment for juveniles?</li>
